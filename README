The goal of this project is to implement a simulator capable of solving Maxwell's equation with the introduction of the magnetic monopole therms. The project is written in rust as an exercice carried out by myself.

Example commands for test phase

cargo build
cargo run

cargo run --bin Initial ./Examples/SingleCharge/config.json
cargo run --bin magnetic_monopoles ./Examples/SingleCharge/config.json
